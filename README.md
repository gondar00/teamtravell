## Project Description
The main objective of this project is to provide the best price + accommodation (In the lowest price ) for people travelling in teams. To achieve this i have added a recommendation button that when clicked checks for the best price that is in between +/- 3 days from the selected date of journey. Also i have added a trip planner that lets to make a list of items that you need to carry along such that people don't forget any important thing behind. The overall goal of this project is to show only REFUNDABLE airplane tickets to people travelling in teams such as to make them plan better and provide them with the best deal available in the market such as to lower the total accommodation+travel cost of the team that in turns reflects an individual.

##Instruction to Run
This application is build around ionic framework and angularjs. To run it you need to have ionic installed in the global level visit the below link for detailed instructions on how to install ionic. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic After successfully installing ionic , browse to the folder where all the files are there. (The folder name is piedpiper) and type in the command line $ionic serve that will start a local server at the port 8100 and will automatically open a new window in firefox. NOTE : The application wont run properly on firefox because 
mm/dd/yyyy
 is still not supported by firefox, kindly please run the url localhost:8100 on google chrome. SOURCE: http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime

For building on android you need to type in the console (after connecting your device and enabling usb debugging or if your using an emulator then i suggest to run the emulator before running this command as the emulator start-up from the console can be very slow(around 15-20min on my i3 processor))

$ionic build android or $ionic build ios and then $ionic run android or $ionic run ios

That's it. This will make the application up and running!
